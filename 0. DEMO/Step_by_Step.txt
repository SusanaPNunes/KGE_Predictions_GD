- This guide has three main phases and provides an example of running a prediction
1. Obtain two embeddings for the pairs you desire to predict an association
2. Obtain a final embedding for each pair through vector operations OR calculate cosine similarity between embeddings
3. Association prediction with machine learning algorithms

######### PHASE 1 ############
!!IMPORTANT!! In the read.me file are the GitHub links for all the original implementations and the needed requirements, such as libraries to run the methods. 

For this phase, you have the folder '1.Embeddings_calculation' with each possible embedding method (python files that start with 'Run_'): RDF2Vec, OPA2Vec, OWL2Vec and OpenKE (TransE and Distmult). 

For each of these embeddings, we have different inputs:
	###############
	### RDF2Vec ### ('Run_RDF2VEC_embeddings.py' and
	 folder 'pyrdf2vec')
	###############

		Open python file and run it
		--> Running KG 1 ontology: Function 'run_embedddings_1kg (ontology_file_path, annotations_file_path, vector_sizes, types_word2vec, n_walks, 																	path_output, entities_file)'

		--> Running 2 ontologies: Function 'run_embedddings(ontology_1_file_path, ontology_2_file_path, annotations_1_file_path,
		                    									annotations_2_file_path, vector_sizes, types_word2vec, n_walks, path_output, entities_file)' 

		There is also a running example in the script with one ontology and one annotation file that you can see. 

		In case of problems with the libraries versions here are some of correct versions that rdf2vec results:
		numpy==1.18.1; scipy==1.4.1; rdflib==4.2.2; gensim==3.8.1; tqdm==4.40.0

	###############
	### OPA2Vec ### ()
	###############

		This embedding has to be runned in the command line so the txt file only has information for you to do that:

		- Download the default pre-trained pubmed model from the original opa2vec GitHub or from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17X7n5pxYZqG_w09HJCC35gmfUnhVl9PM?usp=sharing. This method is pretrained on vectors with 200 features so to change the vector size you need to change the main code inside word2vec.py (opa2vec folder) and pre train on other model or dont pre train at all. 

		- This embedding method only accepts one owl file even if you have more ontologies, so you need to merge them (for instance use ROBOT - http://robot.obolibrary.org/). The same applies to an annotation file. 

		- This method does not need an entities file, but you need to have your all your entities in the KG provided. 

		- Run in Command line inside the opa2vec folder:
			python3 runOPA2Vec.py -ontology "ontology.owl" -associations "AnnotationsFile.tsv" -outfile "Opa2vec_embeddings.txt"

depois ela tem de saber de faz 70-30 split ou 10-fold crossvalidation. se tem de fazer a baseline ou nao.
