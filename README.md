# Predicting Gene-Disease Associations with Knowledge Graph Embeddings over Multiple Ontologies

This repository provides a implementation described in the short paper: http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.04944 



TransE and DistMult implementation in https://github.com/thunlp/OpenKE with default parameters.

RDF2Vec implementation in  https://github.com/IBCNServices/pyRDF2Vec, the sequences are generated using the Weisfeiler-Lehman algorithm with walks depth 8 and a limited number of 500. The corpora of sequences were used to build a Skip-Gram model with the default parameters.

OPA2Vec implementation in https://github.com/bio-ontology-research-group/opa2vec with default parameters.


OWL2Vec* implementation in https://github.com/KRR-Oxford/OWL2Vec-Star with RDF2Vec parameters.
